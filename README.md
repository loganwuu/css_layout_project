# The Best City

##### A mobile friendly multi-column fluid website using CSS — [live preview](http://loganwuu.github.io/css_layout_project ) (11/18/2015)

#### By Logan Wu

## Description
A website created mainly for practicing with CSS layout properties such as inline, inline-block, block, and table ```display```, left and right ```float```, ```clearfix```, and ```box-sizing```. It also incorporates media queries to accomodate varying screen sizes from mobile to tablets to desktop — narrowing down from three-column layout (greater than 1024px) to two-column layout (769px to 1024px) then to one-column layout (smaller than 768px).

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, SVG, normalize.css
